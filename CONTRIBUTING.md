We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and interesting bugs.Report a bug by creating a new issue; it's that easy!!!

### A typical Bug Report tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background


* Steps to reproduce


  * Be specific!


  * Give sample code if you can.


  * What you expected would happen


  * What actually happens 


 * Notes or a good description is recommended.



#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted
